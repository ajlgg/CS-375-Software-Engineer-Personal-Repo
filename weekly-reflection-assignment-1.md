# H1 CS375: Software Engineering - Weekly Standup Reflection
# H2 AJ Luthra

1. My individual contributions to the prior sprint or sprint 0, were completing three parts of the project proposal document, assigning initial roles for the development of the project, setting up specified text channels in our discord server to better organize communication and files, and I contacted and short interviewed three stakeholders to gain feedback.

2. For my upcoming contributions for sprint 1 I plan on being the project manager since I have experience in leadership running an official ursinus club. I will be keeping track of my teams progress, and planning a meeting in person or virtual for sprint 1. Also, I talked with my group and gave the suggestion to start the setup of our application in tandem with any other documents that we need to complete. I volunteered to get the installations and frameworks setup. My reasoning for this is that we have less than a semester at this point to follow an Agile framework, and develop our accalendar system. We need to make sure that we are being diligent and punctual in getting every task completed to the best of our ability. 

3. As of for right now I am little rusty in setting up frameworks for developing applications, and also I am new to the Agile processes, stakeholders, and documenting requirements and what not. However, I am excited to be given the chance to learn how everything falls into place, and overcome the uncomfortability that happens in an actual company team. 

4. I am planning on doing some research and watching tutorial videos to help guide me through completing any tasks that I am unfamiliar with. It is all part of the learning process, and I also plan on working close with my team if there is a complication that I cannot figure out on my own I have them as a resource to try figure it out together. Also, definitely working on my people and communication skills to get the most from our stakeholders.

Gantt Chart for Accalendar

For the gantt chart we are going to need help with this and if there is a template available that would help as well. Two of my team members were not in class today, and also it is something new that I have not done before. Also, we are still unclear about the full timeline of our project. We do have a MVP breakdown with task and estimated hours for each task in our project proposal. I would like to set up a virtual meeting to get assistance with this. Thank you!
