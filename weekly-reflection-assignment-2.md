# H1 CS375: Software Engineering - Weekly Standup Reflection 2
# H2 AJ Luthra


1. My individual contributions to sprint 1, were completing some goals that I set for myself. These include: talking to stakeholders and gathering feedback, applying that feedback and learning and creating a gantt chart as a timeline for our project, adding that gantt chart and contributing to the press release in the requirements document, and I took it upon myself to set up the frameworks for our project environment in VS code. We are going to making our project as a React app using javascript/Node.js which allows us as developers to have an easier time interacting with js libraries and doing error and event handling. For styling we will be using tailwindcss. I struggled a little with that because I forgot that you need to have a certain version installed for it to be compatible with react and npm.

2. For my upcoming contributions since we are still in the week of sprint 1, I plan on figuring out how to properly execute data management and creating the database schema (postgreSQL). Once that is figured out that will be another piece to the project ready to go when it comes down to implementing it in the project as code. We just completed the requirements document which has all of our technical requirements, stakeholder design and questions, graphical timeline, and a press release for final production. 

3. I felt accomplished successfully setting up the framework/environment, but now it comes down to setting priorities and planning each day what my tasks are that need to be completed. Also, I need to be checking in with my team as project manager to make sure they don't feel overwhelmed or if they need help taking some of the load off their shoulders. I take this experience as learning as I go. There are some things that I know and there are some things that I need to maybe refresh on, or learn entirely from scratch.

4. I definitely want to start getting the UI setup for the frontend, and work with my team on that to make sure we are all in agreement on the design. I want to try working as swiftly, but efficiently as possible. Mistakes are iminent and I want to be ready for them, and to not be in spirals. That is why we will do everything on a specific timeline so that we don't mix things up. I am excited to get the frontend looking seamless, and getting the backend logic working to create this brand new app.
